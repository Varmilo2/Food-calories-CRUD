# Calories-project-by-Varmilo
¿Have you ever googled the same thing many times? This also happens to me every time I search for food calories. 

So I decided to create a repository with this information in Python. To do that I made three dictionaries, one for food information, and two for users.

There are two dictionaries for users because the first one is only for the username and the password and the second one for users data like name, surname, age…

During the development of this project I have to deal with some difficulties caused by my limited knowledge in programming:

Strings management 
JSON files use
Registering users accounts and login

Just to not make this post unnecessarily long I will talk about these difficulties in future publications.

To do:
- Unitest
- Create an interface using sys
- Code refactoring is required
